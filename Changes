0.26  Wed Nov 28, 2012
    - Fix multi-pk has_many bug
    - Fix has_many with where conditions

0.25  Thu Apr 12, 2012
    - Suppress DBIC warnings: NULL/undef values supplied for requested
      unique constraint 'primary'.

0.24      2011-05-16 15:34:10 America/New_York
    - Fixed test case that was failing on newer versions of DBIC, which
      is more strict when inspecting relationship join conditions.  You
      will need this when you want to upgrade DBIC.

0.23      2011-02-24 18:23:50 Europe/Vienna
    - Fixed moosified-rs.t failures by making the test skip if not all
      dependencies are met. Requiring Moose for a compatability test would
      have been overkill. (thanks CPANTesters & RT#65959)

0.22      2011-02-09 19:06:34 Europe/Vienna
    - Fixed updating of nullable has_many rels (RT#65561)

    - Warn instead of throwing an exception if a key is neither
      a column, a relationship nor a many-to-many helper.
